## Team Organization


### Team Dynamics

| Good Team Member      | Poor Team Member |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Passion for the product      | Apathetic to the product       |
| Willing to resolve conflicts and communicate when one arises   | Not willing to accept other ideas and does not communicate conflicts        |
|Will communicate blockers |Not mention blockers until it causes larger project related issues |
|Spends individual time being on task |Does not work for the project goals in individual time |
|Performs neccesary research to contribute to project |Does not do any research and blindly uses tools |

### Conflict Resolution

If we reach a conflict, the first thing to do is make it be known that there is a disagreement, so that the issue is communicated with the whole group. From there, we will hold a quick conflict resolution meeting, which could look like messaging back and forth in the Discord, to suggest possible resolutions to the conflict. Should a member want to bring up the conflict with an outside related party, like a related stakeholder, then they may do so to get their honest opinion. (It is best if the conflicted members are made aware of this notification). If the discussion doesn't bring about a agreement, then the whole team will vote about the way that the conflict should be resolved. If the vote bring about an odd number of people, then the leader of the part of the project gets the final word.

 **For example:**

* Business/ product related discussion - Product owner
* Techniques and coding related discussion - Technical leader 
(if disagreement is met between leaders, refer to product owner)
* Development, IDE and version control - Tool Master
* Interpersonal conflicts - Team Master

### Sprint Retrospective

* All goals for Sprint 1 were met, with additional pages being added to our Figma Prototype as we go.
* When we plan for next Sprint, we want to have individual goals set to keep everyone involved.
* Clarification about processes: we will make a new sprint 2 branch, which is built off of sprint 1, and each person will make their own sub branch.
* Jacob will be the server administrator, and Chris will maintain the code base.
