## Team Organization


### Team Dynamics

| Good Team Member      | Poor Team Member |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Passion for the product      | Apathetic to the product       |
| Willing to resolve conflicts and communicate when one arises   | Not willing to accept other ideas and does not communicate conflicts        |
|Will communicate blockers |Not mention blockers until it causes larger project related issues |
|Spends individual time being on task |Does not work for the project goals in individual time |
|Performs neccesary research to contribute to project |Does not do any research and blindly uses tools |

### Conflict Resolution

If we reach a conflict, the first thing to do is make it be known that there is a disagreement, so that the issue is communicated with the whole group. From there, we will hold a quick conflict resolution meeting, which could look like messaging back and forth in the Discord, to suggest possible resolutions to the conflict. Should a member want to bring up the conflict with an outside related party, like a related stakeholder, then they may do so to get their honest opinion. (It is best if the conflicted members are made aware of this notification). If the discussion doesn't bring about a agreement, then the whole team will vote about the way that the conflict should be resolved. If the vote bring about an odd number of people, then the leader of the part of the project gets the final word.

 **For example:**

* Business/ product related discussion - Product owner
* Techniques and coding related discussion - Technical leader 
(if disagreement is met between leaders, refer to product owner)
* Development, IDE and version control - Tool Master
* Interpersonal conflicts - Team Master

### Roles (Application Development)
**Project Manager**
* Christopher Warren - cwarren00@drury.edu



**Team Manager**
* Jali Purcell - jpurcell@drury.edu

**Product Owner**

* Austin Skidmore - askidmore@drury.edu

**Tool Master**
* Jace Reinke - jreinke@drury.edu

**Other Stakeholders** 

* Professor/Team Mentor: Chris Branton - cbranton@drury.edu

## Processes

### Version Control
We will make new branches for each Task in the project board. These task branches will be a created off the 'development' branch in the repository. If the developer believes he/she has completed the task, they will push their changes to their branch and submit a pull request. Pull requests will be reviewed by another member of the team before they are accepted and merged to the 'development' branch. At the end of the project the accumulated codebase will be reviewed and merged at once with the 'main' branch. 

**_Branch Naming Conventions_**
- branches made for program enhancements or tasks will be named as such:
   * ```<task-enhancement-name>```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: ```'task-button-page'```

### Tools
*Team Organization*
* Github Repository & Project Board
  * Github and the Project Board will be used to organize teams progress and processes. The repository will be the primary tool for development, which includes programming, creating and reviewing pull requests, and managing branches. The repository will link to the wiki which includes all necessary documentation. The Project Board will be used for creating issues/tasks for team members and keeping track of what's being done. The board will also be where members of the development team can interact and help each other on specific tasks.
* Discord
  * Discord is the teams communication tool of choice. Our Research & Development Server can be accessed by all members of the development team allowing for open communication about and surrounding the project. 

  
*Code Editor*
* Android Studio 
* Visual Studio Code

## Sprint Retrospective

* All goals for Sprint 1 were met, with additional pages being added to our Figma Prototype as we go.
* When we plan for next Sprint, we want to have individual goals set to keep everyone involved.
* Clarification about processes: we will make a new sprint 2 branch, which is built off of sprint 1, and each person will make their own sub branch.
* Jacob will be the server administrator, and Chris will maintain the code base.
