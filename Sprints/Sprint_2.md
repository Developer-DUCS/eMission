### Sprint Retrospective

* All goals for Sprint 1 were met, with additional pages being added to our Figma Prototype as we go.
* When we plan for next Sprint, we want to have individual goals set to keep everyone involved.
* Clarification about processes: we will make a new sprint 2 branch, which is built off of sprint 1, and each person will make their own sub branch.
* Jacob will be the server administrator, and Chris will maintain the code base.
