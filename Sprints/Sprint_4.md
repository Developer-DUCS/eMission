* The S.E.S (Socio-economic status) of our target market will be middle and upper middle class individuals. People who can afford to make and pursue healthier lifestyle changes.
* To thrive in this application, the ideal user is competive enough to engage in friendly climate-based challenges.
* They will also be regular social media users, eager to share their environmental accomplishments with like-minded people.  
* We plan to reach out to environmental groups like ThinkGreen to test the application.
