### Draft Test Plan
* Understanding what it means to be finished means testing against requirements. The focus here is on acceptance testing. 

**Development**
  * Create a series of tests for the more important functions of our applications
  * Includes Account Creation, Login, Manual Input, Add Vehicle.

**Test**
  * Run the tests, making sure each one is robust and covers as many possibilities as is reasonable.
  * Cover most common use cases, and cases that could break things such as 0,1,-1,null,etc.

**DEBUG**
* Find and resolve issues that arise from failed tests, adjust/add/remove test as needed.

**Decision**
  * Decide if passed tests are sufficient in determinining the completeness of the application.
  * If not, find what changes are required to determine application completeness
    
**Deadline**
* The first project deadline is on March 20th at the end of Sprint 9. This date marks the Beta release for the product and requires the primary features to be complete.
* The second deadline is on May 1st at the end of Sprint 15. This date marks the Final release of the product. Deployment, testing and documentation will be the focus of this sprint. Any additions to the codebase should only be bug fixes. 

**Done**
* Table below outlines the user stories necessary to be considered “done”. Any user stories not in the first column are either not necessary or are recognized as stretch goals.
